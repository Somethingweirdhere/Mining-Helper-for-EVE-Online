# Mining Helper for EVE Online

This simple app let's you select some ores and will fetch their prices in Tradehubs. Then it will display them sorted by your profit so you don't have to worry about things like checking their prices, volumes and doing any calculations. You can also specify systems: Telling the app that you are in a 0.7 Gallente system will make it display only the ores that are avaible there.
